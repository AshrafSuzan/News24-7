But they added that she has improved on many counts and they are hopeful she will recover soon.”  The BNP chairperson, who was released from prison by executive order but is still carrying out a sentence, was admitted to the hospital on Apr 27 after she tested positive for COVID-19.  Though the 76-year-old former prime minister has recently tested negative for the coronavirus, she is still suffering from health complications. Her family had petitioned the government to allow her to go abroad for treatment, but it was denied.  Khaleda’s treatment is being overseen by a 10-member medical board led by Evercare Hospital heart specialist Dr Shahabuddin Talukder.  Fakhrul was accompanied by BNP Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeswar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan during the visit to Zia’s grave. But afterwards he went to Evercare Hospital alone.  Doctors had requested that no one come to visit her at the hospital as she was still in the CCU, so none of her close relatives came to see her on Eid day, as of 5 pm.  Members of the BNP Standing Committee had previously met with Khaleda Zia at her Gulshan home on the two Eids last year. But, as she is in hospital, they have no plans to visit this time.  “This time we have little chance of seeing her because the doctors have forbid it,” Fakhrul said.  In 2018, Khaleda Zia was sentenced to jail over a graft case and imprisoned at the Dhaka Central Prison. She was later transferred to a cabin at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University while still in custody and spent two Eids there.  The prison authorities had allowed visits from relatives and friends on Eid and they had even permitted them to bring her food.', '826065_khaledahealth.jpg', 1, '2021-05-16 18:44:50'),

An official notification on the lockdown will be issued on Sunday and the ongoing restrictions will remain unchanged.  An exodus of people from cities to rural areas for Eid celebrations has stoked fears of a rapid spike in coronavirus cases.  The authorities had ordered the employees of government, semi-government, autonomous and private organisations, banks and non-bank financial institutions not to leave stations during Eid holidays ending on Sunday.  The latest decision by the government is extending the nationwide pandemic restrictions beyond May 16, the last day of the current lockdown.  The government had eased the lockdown restrictions during Eid but kept long-haul passenger transport services on hold mainly to stop the outbreak from spreading to rural areas.  State Minister Farhad on Thursday said: “We can’t say what the outbreak situation will be.”  The government imposed ', '766708_free-dhaka.jpg', 1, '2021-05-16 21:48:50'),

The passengers struggled to make their way back as the long-haul bus service is still closed because of the lockdown. Many were charged extra for their return to their places of work.  Komol Mandul, who came from Bagerhat, said he had paid Tk 600 to travel to Banglabazar from his district by microbus. He says he usually pays only Tk 300.  “It cost me Tk 800 to get to Banglabazar,” said Fatema Rahman, who came from Barishal. “I couldn’t stay away. The office has reopened.”  Fifteen ferries are currently operating on the river route, according to BIWTC Assistant Manager Bhujan Kumar Saha, who is stationed in Kathalbari.  “The rush of passengers began early this morning. They are crossing on the ferries. We tried to prioritise trucks and ambulances. Law enforcers are trying to manage the situation at the port.”  “Ferry service was kept operational on an emergency basis,” says BIWTC AGM Shafiqul Islam. “But people returning to their places of work are swarming onto the ferries to cross the rivers. This is increasing the risk of further spreading the pandemic.” Few people are coming to Shimulia from Dhaka, but there is a torrent of people headed from Madaripur to Dhaka, said Shafiqul.\r\nA lockdown has been imposed across the country in the wake of a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Launch, train and long-haul bus services have been suspended during the duration of the lockdown.\r\n\r\nThe government had instructed people to stay near their places of employment during Eid to try and control the pandemic. But hundreds of thousands of people still made the trip home in the days before Eid.\r\n\r\nEid returnees crowded onto small transport to make the trip home and overwhelmed the ferries with little regard for health restrictions. Several lives were lost in the crush of the crowd on the Shimulia-Banglabazar route.\r\n\r\nThe violation of health regulations and crowding on transport and shopping malls mean that the pandemic situation is likely to worsen, experts say.\r\n\r\nDirector General of Health Services Dr ABM Khurshid Alam has recommended steps to slow the return of those who made the Eid trip home.\r\n\r\n“It will be dangerous if people make their way back in the same manner,” he said. “It would be best to delay their return somewhat. We must also consider how we can bring them back to Dhaka in a proper way.”\r\n\r\nThe government has decided to extend the lockdown by another week in light of the pandemic risks and a notice is expected on Sunday.\r\n\r\n', 'munshiganjshimuliya.jpg', 1, '2021-05-17 08:13:42'),

(11, 'AT&T, in abrupt turn, will shed media business in deal with Discovery', 'Senior Correspondent,news24/7', 3, 13, 'The transaction will combine HBO, Warner Bros. studios, CNN and several other cable networks with a host of reality-based cable channels from Discovery, including Oprah Winfrey’s OWN, HGTV, The Food Network and Animal Planet.\r\n\r\nThe company will join together two of the largest media businesses in the country. AT&T’s WarnerMedia group includes the sports-heavy cable networks TNT and TBS. In addition to Discovery’s strong lineup of reality-based cable channels, the company has a large international sports business.\r\n\r\nThe merger would also be a significant about-face for AT&T, a telecommunications giant better known for servicing fiber lines and cell towers than producing entertainment and courting Hollywood. Industry experts questioned AT&T’s daring purchase of Time Warner at a time when cord-cutting was only accelerating. The spinoff indicates a failed acquisition strategy.\r\n\r\nWarnerMedia is run by Jason Kilar, 50, one of the early pioneers of streaming and the first CEO of Hulu. Discovery has been led for 14 years by David Zaslav, 60, who helped it grow into a reality behemoth. Zaslav will lead the new business.\r\n\r\nThe companies said they expected the deal, which must be approved by Discovery shareholders and regulators, to be finalised in the middle of next year.\r\n\r\nThe new company will be bigger than Netflix or NBCUniversal. Together, WarnerMedia and Discovery generated more than $41 billion in sales last year, with an operating profit topping $10 billion. Such a sum would have put the new company ahead of Netflix and NBCUniversal and behind the Walt Disney Co. as the second-largest media company in the United States.\r\n\r\nTo compete with Netflix and Disney, both AT&T and Discovery have invested heavily in streaming. AT&T has spent billions on building HBO Max, which now has about 20 million customers. Discovery has 15 million global streaming subscribers, most of them for its Discovery+ app.\r\n\r\nJohn Stankey, the CEO of AT&T, has looked at its media business as a way to keep its phone customers from switching to other companies. AT&T Wireless subscribers get discounts and free access to HBO Max. A deal with Discovery could include stipulations that customers would maintain those benefits.\r\n\r\nBefore he took over as CEO last year, Stankey was the company’s chief mergers strategist. But his track record has been spotty. In addition to planning AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner, he was behind the company’s $48 billion acquisition of the satellite operator DirecTV in 2015. The service has been bleeding customers for years; in February, AT&T sold part of the business to the private equity firm TPG for about $16 billion, a third of what it originally paid.\r\n\r\nFor Discovery, the WarnerMedia deal could finally give Zaslav the size and scale he has long sought. A swashbuckling executive who can recall ratings figures off the top of his head, Zaslav represents the last of the old guard in media, a hobnobbing mogul known for hosting lavish get-togethers at his house in the Hamptons in New York.\r\n\r\nThe new company would create a new kind of media behemoth, one that is still living off the fat profits of old-school cable, while spending those profits (and more) on streaming.\r\n\r\nEven with increased competition, HBO remains a standout in television, and last year, once again, captured more Emmys than any other network, studio or platform, including Netflix. It has several hit shows, including “Succession,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Barry” and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” It also has a huge library that includes “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones” and “Sex and the City.”', '970688_AT&T.jpg', 1, '2021-05-18 20:56:59'),

(19, 'A surprise ending for the Oscars’ inclusive night', 'Media Correspondent,news24/7', 5, 7, 'It was easy to understand why. The late Chadwick Boseman, nominated for his visceral performance in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” was the runaway favourite, and an acceptance speech by his widow was sure to be an emotional moment. Further, the best actor prize had gone to a Black man only four times in 93 years, and celebrating Boseman at the night’s climax — after a year in which racial justice was at the forefront of the country’s consciousness — would put an exclamation point on the academy’s aggressive diversity and inclusion efforts over the past few years.\r\n\r\nIt backfired in spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\nThe film establishment instead went with Anthony Hopkins, rewarding his performance in “The Father” as a man suffering from dementia. Apparently certain that Boseman would win, Hopkins had decided not to attend the ceremony. With no one there to accept the award, the Oscars telecast abruptly ended, leaving the academy to face questions about whether it had misjudged its voting body.\r\n\r\n“At 83 years old, I did not expect to get this award — I really didn’t,” Hopkins said in a video speech released Monday morning from his hometown in Wales and during which he paid tribute to Boseman.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which declined to make officials available for interviews Monday, has spent the past few years trying to get its house in order after being excoriated for putting forward all-white slates of acting nominees in both 2015 and 2016. It has scrambled to enact diversity-focused reforms, most notably inviting about 4,000 artists and executives — with a focus on women and people from underrepresented groups — to become members. The organization now has about 10,000 voters. It says that about 19% of its members are from underrepresented racial and ethnic communities, up from 10% in 2015.\r\n\r\nThis year’s ceremony had a chance to be a showcase for those efforts. Going into Sunday night, some awards handicappers predicted that movie history would be made, with all four acting Oscars going to people of colour for the first time. Along with Boseman, Viola Davis was seen as a leading contender for the best actress prize for playing a blues singer in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” Best actress instead went to Frances McDormand for playing a dour van dweller in “Nomadland.” It was her third best-actress statuette.\r\n\r\nStill, the most diverse group of nominees in Oscar history resulted in several notable victories for supporting roles: Daniel Kaluuya, who played Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” and Yuh-Jung Youn, for her comically cantankerous grandmother in “Minari.” She was the first Korean performer to win an acting Oscar, and only the second Asian woman. Chloé Zhao, who is Chinese, took home the best director prize, only the second woman to do so in Oscar history and the first woman of color.\r\n\r\nTwo Black women, Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson, won Oscars for makeup and hairstyling for the first time. Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) was the first woman to take home a solo screenwriting Oscar in 13 years. And director Travon Free was the first Black man to win in the best live-action short category. He was recognised for “Two Distant Strangers,” a film about police brutality that he made with Martin Desmond Roe.\r\n\r\n“This is the blackest Oscars of all time,” quipped Lil Rel Howery, who served as an MC for a music trivia game that took place toward the end of the telecast and featured Glenn Close dancing to “Da Butt,” a song from the soundtrack to Spike Lee’s “School Daze.”\r\n\r\nMany agreed that the diversity of this year’s winners proved that the movie industry had become more inclusive. Others wonder if it is simply another anomaly in a strange year, one in which most studios delayed releasing many of their bigger-budget films because theatres were closed across the country, and those movies that were released tended to be smaller, independent films seen largely on streaming services — if they were seen at all.\r\n\r\n“Like everything else, the pandemic affected the way movies were released, which affected, ultimately, the way people in films were nominated,” said Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts. “It’ll be difficult to know, until a few more years pass, whether this year is actually representative of something or if it’s just a circumstance of the pandemic.”\r\n\r\nHollywood has been here before. In 2002, when Halle Berry won best actress for “Monster’s Ball,” best actor went to Denzel Washington (“Training Day”). It was the first time those prizes were awarded to people of colour in the same year, prompting Washington to remark “Two birds in one night” from the Oscar stage.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be a moment of progress. But since then no other Black woman has won best actress, and the last Black man to win best actor was Forest Whitaker (“The Last King of Scotland”) in 2007. The academy has been a bit more inclusive in supporting categories. In the previous 20 years, there had been four Latino or Black supporting actor winners (none have been Asian), and six Black supporting actress winners (none were Asian or Latina).\r\n\r\n“There’s so much work to do, guys, and that’s on everyone in this room,” Kaluuya said during his acceptance speech. “That’s not a single-man job. Every single one of you has work to do.”\r\n\r\nThe academy’s efforts to diversify its membership came after decades of relative stagnation. In 2008, for instance, only 105 people were invited to join.\r\n\r\nAs part of its 2016 overhaul pledge, the group sharply increased the Oscar voting pool, inviting 4,046 artists and executives to become members over five years, including 1,383 from overseas. Virtually everyone invited to join the academy accepts, though not all. One of the industry’s most prominent Black directors, Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther”), recently revealed that he did not accept the academy’s overtures.\r\n\r\nLast year, the academy announced a plan that will require films to meet diversity criteria to be eligible for a best-picture nomination, starting with the 2024 awards.\r\n\r\nStill, those who have been critical of the way the film industry operates are not ready to heap too much praise on the academy’s efforts.\r\n\r\n“What we have to constantly recognise is that an institution like the academy didn’t give anything to Black people,” said Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organisation Colour of Change. “What the academy has done over the years is have a system and a set of rules that has stalled Black careers, which has prevented people from being able to be fully seen, which has had an economic impact on folks. Now that they are working to make some changes, let’s acknowledge those changes but let’s not give them any awards that they haven’t earned.”\r\n\r\nThe years long process has been wrenching for the academy.\r\n\r\nInside the secretive organization, factions formed, with some people insisting that the problem was not with the academy, but with film companies and the lack of opportunities they provide for people of colour. That many of the academy members also worked for these companies was another point of contention.\r\n\r\nA glimpse of the animosity came when Bill Mechanic, an Oscar-nominated producer and former studio executive, resigned from the academy’s board in 2018.\r\n\r\n“We have settled on numeric answers to the problem of inclusion, barely recognizing that this is the industry’s problem far, far more than it is the academy’s,” Mechanic wrote in his resignation letter, which was leaked to the news media. “Instead we react to pressure. One governor even went as far as suggesting we don’t admit a single white male to the academy, regardless of merit!”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, some people have turned away from the Oscars because of its lack of diversity. Under 10 million viewers tuned into Sunday night’s telecast, according to Nielson, a 58% drop compared with last year. One member of the academy’s board of governors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules, said that market research had shown that people of colour, upset about the racial disparity of nominees (and tired of seeing many of the same people get nominated over and over), had become less interested in the ceremony. A couple of smaller civil rights groups have called for viewing boycotts.\r\n\r\nThat was the case for April Reign, the campaign finance lawyer who originated the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag in 2015. Despite the changes at the organization, she said she believed the academy’s efforts to diversify its voting body had fallen short.\r\n\r\n“It’s still a popularity contest among all the white men,” she said.\r\n\r\nOthers see reason for optimism in this year’s Oscars, no matter how they ended.\r\n\r\n“To have a film about Fred Hampton that doesn’t demonize him but instead celebrates him, and provides this broader story from a group of Black filmmakers, is, you know, kind of hard to believe that it would even be made much less be nominated,” Boyd said of “Judas and the Black Messiah.” “And we could go through each of these examples. It’s great. It’s wonderful. I just don’t want it to be an isolated incident.”', '544912_oscars.jpg', 1, '2021-05-18 21:29:19'),

Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire, so it was a relaxed affair: Neighbours gathered and firefighters allowed children to take turns holding the hose.\r\n\r\nRoth remembers watching the flames engulf the house when her father, an amateur photographer, asked her to smile. With her hair askew and a knowing look in her eyes, Roth flashed a devilish smirk as the fire roared behind her. “Disaster Girl” was born.\r\n\r\nIn the years since Dave Roth, Zoë’s father, entered it in a photo contest in 2007 and won, the image has been edited into various disasters from history, with Roth grinning impishly as a meteor wipes out the dinosaurs or the Titanic sinks in the distance. Now, after more than a decade of having her image endlessly repurposed as a vital part of meme canon, Roth has sold the original copy of her meme as a nonfungible token, or NFT, for nearly $500,000.\r\n\r\nThe meme sold for 180 Ether, a form of cryptocurrency, at an auction on April 17 to a user identified as @3FMusic. As with any currency, the value of Ether fluctuates, but as of Thursday, 180 Ether was valued at more than $495,000. The Roths retained the copyright and will receive 10% of future sales.\r\n\r\nThe market for ownership rights to digital art, ephemera and media known as NFTs, is exploding. All NFTs, including the “Disaster Girl” meme Roth just sold, are stamped with a unique bit of digital code that marks their authenticity, and stored on the blockchain, a distributed ledger system that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nIn the meme hall of fame, “Disaster Girl” ranks alongside “Ermahgerd,” a pigtailed teenage girl posing with “Goosebumps” books; “Bad Luck Brian,” immortalised in a grimacing yearbook photo with braces; and “Success Kid,” a toddler on a beach with a clenched fist and an expression of intense determination.', '706249_friends.jpg', 1, '2021-05-18 21:34:37'),
